Prospectus
Team Description
Our group was assigned the musical fountain program and simulator requested by the city of Grand Haven. The team members on our group include Nicholas Paquette, Michael Kinkema, and Raleigh Mumford. In this prospectus, we will write about the program and simulator we have been asked to work on by city of Grand Haven, including the list of features they have requested be implemented into the program, as well as about each member of our group, our experiences and how we expect to grow by doing this project.

Description of the project
Our project is to develop and design a piece of software which will be used by end users in the general public to create a custom light show to go along with music for the Grand Haven fountains.  This software will be easy to use and bug free so anyone can create their own project and submit it to be reviewed by the city of Grand Haven; at which point the city will decide whether or not to use the choreography. 
The current state of the project is relatively finished as stated by Terry at Apex Controls however we are running into more and more issues the farther we get into the project.  Unfortunately at the moment the jar executable provided from the last class will not even run but that could just be a small issue of Java versions.  We were told during our meeting that the final project turned in from the last group did create a light show unfortunately it differ from benchmark software Apex used to test the project, the main difference being that the simulation did not show the correct animations or colors.  This could be due to small bugs in the software or the test trying to make use of certain features not yet implemented by the last team.  Documenting each feature, whether it works or not, will be the first phase of the project. It was decided by our team and also Terry from Apex Controls that the best course of action for the project would be to start with picking a benchmark song and create light shows with the previous semester’s software as well as the benchmark software to determine where they differed and ultimately where the bugs are.  Terry also raised the question of whether Java was correct language for this project but it was decided by our team that it would be the easiest to maintain in the future as well as the most portable for implementation of end user’s machines.  We will further validate our choice to retain Java by researching Java’s performance capabilities, which were also questioned by Apex Controls.
After the project, its bugs, and expected features are fully documented, we will begin fixing the old code.  We will not be adding any additional features until it is known and tested that the core of the program functions.  When additional features: such as light fading, water sweeping, and custom color palettes, are being worked on, we will not move on to the next feature until the current feature is fully validated and bug free.

Technical Strengths
Raleigh Mumford’s greatest technical strengths are in the back end of developing with implementing well written algorithms and optimization of code.  Drawing from his experience from engineering classes he has some experience with embedded systems. This is not directly applicable for the bulk of our project but will definitely help the other team members understand the hardware that were our software will be outputting to as well as the engineering drawing given to us of the fountains.
Michael Kinkema has a strong background developing user friendly applications as well as analyzing and optimizing code. He writes well documented and easily maintainable code, helping the scale of this project be a bit less overwhelming. He also is experienced with the use and administration of version control systems, primarily Git. 
Finally, Nicholas Paquette’s strengths lie in his ability to quickly learn new techniques and adapt to new challenges. With more of a broad range of abilities rather than a focused area of expertise, Nicholas can handle several different areas of the project. His strongest area, though, is code management and organization, making sure that code is readable and easy to understand. Nick is skilled in multiple programming languages, including Java, the C family, Ruby, Python, and SQL, and has primarily used Eclipse as his IDE of choice.

Technical Growth
For technical growth Raleigh is most looking forward to working with the GUI for the project as he does not have much experience with front end developing.  He is also excited to be challenged by going into a project which he does not know much about and is already developed extensively.  This is something new to him as he has mostly been developing software from start to finish for school related projects and any programing outside of school.  Testing is also something he is looking forward to doing since learning about it in CIS-350 since most programs written were small and only in need of a small amount of testing.  It will be nice to deliver a program at the end of the semester bug free and thoroughly tested so it can be implemented and sent out to the general public without having to worry if it will break or not.
Michael hopes to gain experience primarily with testing. This includes verifying that the code is free of bugs and that it is also free of semantic errors. On top of that, knowledge of testing tools to find bugs, find bottlenecks, and validate programs across multiple systems will be gained. Apart from testing, Michael expects to gain valuable experience working on a pre-existing code base, rather than one that was implemented by him from scratch, as well as working with a small team for an extended period of time, gaining experience with pair programming and generally working with others.
Nicholas Paquette, meanwhile, is excited to gain real experience in programming outside of schoolwork. For his internship, he worked for an IT company, and couldn’t gain experience in programming. Working on something that will actually have real-world effects has always been an exciting idea. The musical fountain, while sounding like a challenging project from peers, would be an excellent chance to make something special for both the city of Grand Haven and its population. Furthermore, he is also looking forward to gaining experience with the Git software, as he realizes how powerful the program is and how widely it is used in today’s industry. Finally, Nick is looking forward to simply gaining even more experience with coding in general, hoping to put these experiences to use someday in creating his own video game. Nick knows that he still has much to learn, but is also ready to put what he already knows to use and is looking forward to working on this project.



Note: We are unable to provide a full feature list/ timeline at this point in time. Due to a lack of certainty about the current status of the code. Part of our project will be evaluating the current implementation and documenting the state of each function as well as the bugs. Apex will be providing us with a base case to test each feature within the next two weeks.
